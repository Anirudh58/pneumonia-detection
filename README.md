# pneumonia-detection

## Dataset
- Taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset)

## Approach
- See [notebook](https://github.com/Anirudh58/pneumonia-detection/blob/master/train.ipynb) for approach and sample evaluations on test set

## TODO
- High false positives currently probably due to class imbalances. Use something like WeightedRandomSampler to efficiently mitigate this.
